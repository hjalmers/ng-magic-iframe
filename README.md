# :warning: Deprecated => New version available [here](https://github.com/sebgroup/magic-iframe) :rocket:
This component has been replaced by https://github.com/sebgroup/magic-iframe which pretty much is a drop-in replacement with some added features. It's been rebuilt as web component with stencil so it works with native javascript as well as popular frameworks like react, angular, vue etc. If you're looking for the old documentation for the ng version you can find it [here](https://github.com/sebgroup/ng-magic-iframe/blob/master/README-OLD.md).
